- **AI Technique(s)**: The paper utilizes large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, focusing on an adaptive reasoning and acting mechanism for doctor agents, incorporating a self-correction mechanism.
- **Healthcare Application**: The application is in the domain of medical diagnostics, specifically within simulated clinical environments using the MedQA dataset and evaluated with the AgentClinic benchmark.
- **Methodology**: The model pipeline involves four main agents: the Doctor Agent (which diagnoses), the Patient Agent (which simulates patient responses), the Measurement Agent (which provides test results), and the Moderator Agent (which evaluates the accuracy of diagnoses). The Doctor Agent interacts with the Patient Agent to gather information, requests tests from the Measurement Agent, and makes diagnoses. If a diagnosis fails, the system concatenates the return with self-correction to form a new initial state for the next trial, iteratively refining the diagnostic process until a correct diagnosis is achieved or a maximum number of trials is reached.
