\section{Abstract}
\begin{frame}{Abstract}
This research proposal aims to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Language Model (LLM) specifically designed for the retrieval of medical papers. The proposed model will utilize a centralized vector store to efficiently pull papers, articles, and journals in bulk. The motivation behind this proposal is to address the challenges faced by researchers in the healthcare field when searching for relevant literature, which can often be time-consuming and ineffective.

\section{Background \& Literature Review}
\begin{frame}{Background \& Literature Review}
Efficiently retrieving relevant medical literature is essential for researchers to stay informed about the latest advancements. Traditional methods like keyword searches in databases such as PubMed or Google Scholar have limitations in terms of precision, recall, and time consumption. The exponential growth of medical literature poses a challenge for researchers to keep up with the vast amount of information available. To address this challenge, advanced techniques like machine learning and natural language processing are being explored to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval in the medical field.

\section{Problem Statement \& Research Gap}
\begin{frame}{Problem Statement \& Research Gap}
The current retrieval systems for medical papers, articles, and journals are inefficient and time-consuming, requiring users to manually search through multiple databases and sources to find relevant information. This process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and lacks a centralized vector store for academic literature, hindering researchers' ability to access and analyze information effectively.

Research Gap:
Despite advancements in information retrieval technology, there is a significant gap in the development of a comprehensive and efficient retrieval system tailored for medical literature. Existing systems struggle to accurately retrieve relevant information and are ill-equipped to handle the vast amount of data in the medical field. The absence of a centralized vector store for academic literature presents a challenge in building a cohesive retrieval system that can efficiently pull papers, articles, and journals on a large scale. This research proposal aims to address these gaps by developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM that utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to enhance the retrieval process and provide seamless access to medical literature through a centralized vector store.

\section{Limitations or Ethical Considerations}
\begin{frame}{Limitations or Ethical Considerations}
Limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Data Privacy: Concerns may arise regarding the privacy and confidentiality of medical papers stored in a centralized vector store. It is imperative to safeguard sensitive patient information to prevent any compromise.
    \item Biases: The algorithms used for retrieving medical papers may introduce biases, potentially skewing the results. Addressing and mitigating these biases during the development of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM is crucial.
    \item Scaling Challenges: The increasing volume of medical papers poses challenges in scaling the centralized vector store to efficiently handle and retrieve large amounts of data. Ensuring the system's capability to manage the growing information load is a critical consideration.
\end{enumerate}

Ethical Considerations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Informed Consent: Researchers must obtain informed consent from individuals whose medical papers are stored in the centralized vector store. It is essential to ensure that individuals understand how their data will be utilized and protected.
    \item Transparency: Transparency about the algorithms and processes involved in the retrieval and storage of medical papers is vital. Providing clear information about the system's operations will foster trust among users.
    \item Accountability: Researchers are accountable for the ethical implications of developing and utilizing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM. This includes ensuring responsible and ethical use of the system, as well as mitigating any potential risks.
