This research proposal aims to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Language Model (LLM) for the retrieval of medical papers, enabling a centralized vector store to mass pull papers, articles, and journals. The motivation behind this proposal is to streamline the process of accessing relevant medical literature for researchers and healthcare professionals, ultimately improving the efficiency and effectiveness of academic research in healthcare.

\section*{Background \& Literature Review}
Background:

Efficiently retrieving relevant medical papers, articles, and journals is essential in the field of medical research to stay informed about the latest advancements. However, manual searching through databases is time-consuming and inefficient. As a result, there is a growing interest in developing automated systems to streamline the retrieval process of medical papers.

Literature Review:

Current methods for retrieving medical papers involve keyword searches in databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. While these databases are valuable resources, they have limitations in terms of search result precision and recall. Keyword searches may overlook relevant papers that do not contain the exact keywords used in the search query, leading to incomplete information retrieval.

Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have led to the development of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) language models (LLMs). RAG LLMs combine retrieval and generation models to enhance the accuracy and relevance of search results. These models can retrieve relevant documents from a centralized vector store and generate summaries or answers based on the retrieved information.

Academic summaries of RAG LLMs have shown promising results in various domains, such as question-answering tasks and information retrieval. These models have proven their ability to retrieve relevant information from large datasets and generate coherent responses, making them valuable for improving the efficiency of medical paper retrieval.

Developing a RAG LLM specifically for medical paper retrieval could streamline the process of accessing relevant information for researchers. This model could utilize a centralized vector store to efficiently pull papers, articles, and journals, providing researchers with a comprehensive and up-to-date repository of medical literature.

In conclusion, a RAG LLM for medical paper retrieval has the potential to transform how researchers access and utilize information in the medical field. By leveraging NLP and machine learning capabilities, this model could overcome the limitations of current retrieval methods and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of medical research.

\section*{Problem Statement \& Research Gap}
Problem Statement:
The current retrieval systems for medical literature are inefficient and time-consuming, requiring users to manually search through multiple databases and sources to find relevant information. This process is labor-intensive and error-prone, leading to inconsistencies in the retrieval of information.
