      "- **AI Technique(s)**: The paper utilizes large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, as the GenAI methods. These models are employed as language agents in the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Healthcare Application**: The application is in the domain of diagnostic accuracy within simulated clinical environments, specifically using the AgentClinic benchmark and the MedQA dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Methodology**: The methodology involves an LLM agent framework where doctor agents iteratively refine their reasoning and actions following incorrect diagnoses. The process includes dynamic interactions with simulated patients, involving doctor-patient dialogue, medical test interpretation, and bias management. The framework introduces an adaptive feedback loop that allows the doctor agent to learn from mistakes and improve over time. The initial state is compressed to reduce context length, and the model iteratively refines its actions based on feedback from previous trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Key Findings or Contributions**: The main contributions include the introduction of a robust adaptation mechanism for doctor agents, enabling them to improve diagnostic accuracy after initial failures. The study demonstrates that the proposed framework can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of LLM doctor agents over time. The GPT-4 model was able to correctly diagnose Myasthenia Gravis, while the GPT-3.5 model initially failed but succeeded after incorporating a correction. The framework shows potential for autonomous agents in healthcare, highlighting the importance of systems that learn from experience.\n",
