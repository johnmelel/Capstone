Background & Literature Review Draft:
Background:

In the field of medical research, the ability to efficiently retrieve relevant papers, articles, and journals is crucial for staying up-to-date with the latest advancements and findings. However, the sheer volume of medical literature available can make this task overwhelming and time-consuming. Traditional methods of searching for medical papers often rely on keyword searches or manual browsing through databases, which can be inefficient and may not always yield the most relevant results.

Literature Review:

Existing systems for medical paper retrieval, such as PubMed and Google Scholar, have limitations that hinder their effectiveness. These systems often rely on keyword matching, which can lead to irrelevant results or miss important papers that do not contain the exact keywords used in the search query. Additionally, these systems do not always take into account the context or relevance of the papers, making it difficult for researchers to quickly find the information they need.

Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning have shown promise in improving the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval systems. One such approach is the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Language Model (LLM), which combines retrieval-based and generation-based methods to enhance the search process. By leveraging a centralized vector store to mass pull papers, articles, and journals, a RAG LLM can provide more contextually relevant results and improve the overall search experience for researchers.

Revised Background & Literature Review:
Background:

Efficiently accessing relevant medical literature is essential in the field of medical research to stay informed about the latest advancements. However, the vast amount of available medical literature can make this task overwhelming and time-consuming. Traditional methods of searching for medical papers often involve keyword searches or manual browsing through databases, which may not always yield the most relevant results.

Literature Review:

Current systems for medical paper retrieval, such as PubMed and Google Scholar, have limitations that impact their effectiveness. These systems primarily rely on keyword matching, which can result in irrelevant results or overlook important papers that do not contain the exact keywords used in the search query.

Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning have shown potential in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval systems. One promising approach is the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Language Model (LLM), which integrates retrieval-based and generation-based methods to improve the search process. By utilizing a centralized vector store to retrieve papers, articles, and journals, a RAG LLM can offer more contextually relevant results and enhance the overall search experience for researchers.
