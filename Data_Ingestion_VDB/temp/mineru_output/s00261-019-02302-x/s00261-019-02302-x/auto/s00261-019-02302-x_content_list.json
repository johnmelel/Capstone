However, anatomic and histologic mimics of prostate cancer on mpMRI exist. Anatomic feature that mimic prostate cancer on mpMRI include anterior fbromuscular stroma, normal central zone, periprostatic venous plexus, and thickened surgical capsule (transition zone pseudocapsule). Benign conditions such as post-biopsy hemorrhage, prostatitis or infammation, focal prostate atrophy, benign prostatic hyperplasia nodules, and prostatic calcifcations can also mimic prostate cancer on mpMRI. Technical challenges and other pitfalls such as image distortion, motion artifacts, and endorectal coil placements can also limit the efcacy of mpMRI. Knowledge of prostate anatomy, location of the lesion and its imaging features on diferent sequences, and being familiar with the common pitfalls are critical for the radiologists who interpret mpMRI. Therefore, this article reviews the pitfalls (anatomic structures and technical challenges) and benign lesions or abnormalities that may mimic prostate cancer on mpMRI and how to interpret them. ",

Despite, the increasing use of mpMRI for prostate cancer diagnosis, about $1 5 - 3 0 \\%$ of all clinically signifcant cancers can be missed by radiologists [1, 2]. Moreover, there is large inter-observer variability in the interpretation of mpMRI among radiologists [3]. In addition, there are several pitfalls which can mimic prostate cancer or hinder its diagnosis on mpMRI. Normal anatomical structures and benign processes may have similar imaging features to PCa and lead to false positive results. Some of these entities can be recognized by their imaging features, while others cannot be confdently distinguished from PCa. Knowledge of prostate anatomy, location of the lesion and its imaging features on diferent sequences, and being familiar with the common pitfalls are critical for the radiologists who interpret mpMRI. In this article, we will review the pitfalls (anatomic structures and technical challenges) and benign lesions or abnormalities and that may mimic PCa on mpMRI. ",

It is composed of connective tissue, smooth muscle, and some skeletal muscle. It extends from the apex to the base of the prostate. It is typically thicker at midline. The prostate capsule blends with the AFMS and in the majority of cases $(89 \\% )$ , the AFMS forms the only anterior covering of the prostate [4]. Laterally, the AFMS fuses with the lateral pelvic fascia and covers outermost regions of the lateral and anterior surfaces of the prostate in the majority of cases $(8 5 \\% )$ [5]. AFMS has low signal on T2WI with low ADC values and therefore, can obscure an anterior tumor or mimic PCa when asymmetric (Fig. 1). Normal AFMS has a benign progressive (type 1) curve at DCE [6]. Symmetric appearance and DCE-MRI characteristics are helpful in diferentiating AFMS from anterior cancer. ",

Anatomically, the seminal vesicles are located posterosuperiorly and drain into the mid prostatic urethra via the ejaculatory ducts in the region of the verumontanum. The central zone surrounds the ejaculatory ducts and is located posterior to the transition zone and the urethra proximal to the verumontanum [11]. Typically, the central zone (CZ) is symmetric, is homogenous low signal on T2WI, has low uniform ADC and does not show focal early enhancement on DCE-MRI as seen in Fig. 2. However, the ADC of benign CZ is lower than the ADC of other zones of the prostate and has overlap even with signifcant PCa [12]. On DCE-MRI, the normal CZ has a progressive (type 1) or plateau (type 2) enhancement curve [13]. DCE-MRI and symmetric appearances at expected location are the key features diferentiating normal CZ from cancer. ",

Following the veins as tubular structures on multiple planes and recognizing, the prostate boundary will help the reader identify the plexus.

They have low ADC signal and demonstrate early enhancement with washout on DCE-MR images mimicking PCa (Fig. 8) [43, 44]. Glandular BPH are not hyperintense on ADC and T2 as previously thought [44], and have similar appearance on mpMRI as stromal BPH [43]. Cystic BPH are well demarcated and, have higher fuid content due to cystic ectasia and hyperplastic glandular components. They tend to be hyperintense on T2 and ADC images and do not show any early enhancement of DCE-MRI, making it easy to distinguish from PCa. A recent study [43] showed that quantitative ADC values could be used to diferentiate between PCa and BPH, as ADC for PCa was lower compared to all BPH types. T2 values were found to be signifcantly lower in PCa compared to cystic BPH only, while glandular and stromal BPH showed no signifcant diference from PCa. DCEMRI was not found to be useful for distinguishing PCa from BPH. ",

BPH nodules located in the PZ (Fig. 9) are usually well circumscribed, ovoid or round, and do not extend to the capsule [48]. They have low T2 and ADC signal with avid early enhancement and washout very similar to PZ cancers. Their well-defined borders, location (adjacent to TZ), and round shape are the important imaging findings in their differentiation from PZ cancer.

They can be associated with disease processes such as BPH, infection, and metabolic abnormalities [52]. Corpora amylacea are presumably precursors to calcifed “stones”. Analysis of the proteins in prostatic corpora amylacea and calculi found that the predominant proteins comprising these concretions are proteins involved in acute infammation, and in particular proteins contained in neutrophil granules [53]. Prostate calcifcations in the prostate are commonly seen at the junction between the transition zone and peripheral zone against the background of BPH. They are typically hypointense on T2W and ADC, with low signal intensity on DWI at all $^ b$ values due to the dielectric efect of calcium in the calcifcation and do not show early enhance on DCE-MRI (Fig. 10). Complete lack of enhancement on MRI is important in their diferentiation from PCa. Correlation with CT can be helpful in confrming focal calcifcation. While corpora amylacea can occur within foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, their incidence is low and are more associated with low Gleason grade cancers [54]. ",
