      "countries around the world [4]. \n",
      "As a response to the growth in the use of mpMRI, the Prostate Im­\n",
      "aging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) guidelines, the most recent \n",
      "iteration being the PI-RADSv2.1, were introduced to standardize pros­\n",

      "PI-RADSv2 established the minimum technical requirements for the \n",
      "acquisition of the individual MRI sequences with the goal of standard­\n",
      "izing imaging protocols and reducing variability in image quality [6]. \n",
      "Nevertheless, adherence to these requirements is variable across both \n",
      "academic and non-academic institutions and does not necessarily \n",

      "unrecognized, and the diagnostic performance of mpMRI of the prostate, \n",
      "especially in non-academic centers, is assumed to be similar to published \n",
