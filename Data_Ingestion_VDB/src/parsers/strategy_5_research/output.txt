	## Abstract
	
	
	
	Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate has evolved to be an integral component for the diagnosis, risk stratification, staging, and targeting of prostate cancer. However, anatomic and histologic mimics of prostate cancer on mpMRI exist. Anatomic feature that mimic prostate cancer on mpMRI include anterior fibromuscular stroma, normal central zone, periprostatic venous plexus, and thickened surgical capsule (transition zone pseudocapsule). Benign conditions such as post-biopsy hemorrhage, prostatitis or inflammation, focal prostate atrophy, benign prostatic hyperplasia nodules, and prostatic calcifications can also mimic prostate cancer on mpMRI.

	Technical challenges and other pitfalls such as image distortion, motion artifacts, and endorectal coil placements can also limit the efficacy of mpMRI. Knowledge of prostate anatomy, location of the lesion and its imaging features on different sequences, and being familiar with the common pitfalls are critical for the radiologists who interpret mpMRI. Therefore, this article reviews the pitfalls (anatomic structures and technical challenges) and benign lesions or abnormalities that may mimic prostate cancer on mpMRI and how to interpret them.

	## Introduction
	
	Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate has evolved to be an integral component for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and staging of prostate cancer (PCa). Despite, the increasing use of mpMRI for prostate cancer diagnosis, about 15-30% of all clinically significant cancers can be missed by radiologists . Moreover, there is large inter-observer variability in the interpretation of mpMRI among radiologists . In addition, there are several pitfalls which can mimic prostate cancer or hinder its diagnosis on mpMRI. Normal anatomical structures and benign processes may have similar imaging features to PCa and lead to false positive results. Some of these entities can be recognized by their imaging features, while others cannot be confidently distinguished from PCa. Knowledge of prostate anatomy,

	## Anatomic structures mimicking PCa
	
	## Anterior fibromuscular stroma
	
	
	
	The anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFMS) is a band of fibromuscular tissue that forms the anterior surface of the prostate, and is located anterior to the transition zone. It is composed of connective tissue, smooth muscle, and some skeletal muscle. It extends from the apex to the base of the prostate. It is typically thicker at midline. The prostate capsule blends with the AFMS and in the majority of cases (89%), the AFMS forms the only anterior covering of the prostate . Laterally, the AFMS fuses with the lateral pelvic fascia and covers outermost regions of the lateral and anterior surfaces of the prostate in the majority of cases (85%) . AFMS has low signal on T2WI with low ADC values and therefore, can obscure an anterior tumor or mimic PCa when asymmetric (Fig. 1).

	Symmetric appearance and DCE-MRI characteristics are helpful in differentiating AFMS from anterior cancer.
	
	
	
	Anterior cancers account for about 20% of all PCa and tend to have higher rates of extracapsular extension . Most anterior tumors are located in the anterior third and inferior half of the TZ or in the AFMS . In contrast to AFMS, anterior tumors are asymmetric and have a washout (type-3) enhancement curve with earlier enhancement than normal AFMS . The consultation of T2W images in coronal and sagittal planes can confirm the continuity of the hypertrophic anterior fibromuscular stroma with the benign tissue .

	and embryologic features . Anatomically, the seminal vesicles are located posterosuperiorly and drain into the mid prostatic urethra via the ejaculatory ducts in the region of the verumontanum. The central zone surrounds the ejaculatory ducts and is located posterior to the transition zone and the urethra proximal to the verumontanum . Typically, the central zone (CZ) is symmetric, is homogenous low signal on T2WI, has low uniform ADC and does not show focal early enhancement on DCE-MRI as seen in Fig. 2. However, the ADC of benign CZ is lower than the ADC of other zones of the prostate and has overlap even with significant PCa . On DCE-MRI, the normal CZ has a progressive (type 1) or plateau (type 2) enhancement curve .

While central zone cancers account only for 0.5-2.5% of all PCa, they tend to have a higher Gleason grade, and more likely to invade the seminal vesicles, and have extracapsular extension. They are also prone to biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy . Uneven hypertrophy of the TZ can cause asymmetric displacement of the CZ which can be seen as an area of focal signal abnormality near the peripheral zone (PZ) and present as a pseudolesion (asymmetric CZ). The asymmetric CZ will have a benign enhancement curve on DCE-MRI.

	Another CZ related pitfall is the presence of focal hypointense region near the ejaculatory glands at the base of the prostate. This is related to the posterior bulging of the central zone over the verumontanum. This pitfall can show mildly restricted diffusion and early focal enhancement on DCE-MRI. The use of coronal and sagittal planes can be useful to demonstrate continuity and symmetry of the CZ.

	The use of coronal and sagittal planes can be useful to demonstrate continuity and symmetry of the CZ.
	
	## Periprostatic venous plexus
	
	
	
	The prostate is drained by the periprostatic venous plexus that lies along the posterolateral aspect of the gland. This plexus then communicates with the dorsal venous plexus (Santorini) and hemorrhoidal venous plexus posteriorly to drain into the internal iliac vein . The diameter and number of the veins varies by age and is more pronounced in younger patients and patients with smaller glands .

	The diameter and number of the veins varies by age and is more pronounced in younger patients and patients with smaller glands .
	
	
	
	The periprostatic veins are tubular structures and can be hypointense on T2W and ADC depending on blood flow velocity and turbulence (Fig. 3). Veins close to the peripheral zone may be mistaken for a peripheral zone PCa particularly in areas where the prostatic pseudocapsule is indistinct and partial volume averaging can hinder discerning the prostate boundary .

	with low ADC). Following the veins as tubular structures on multiple planes and recognizing, the prostate boundary will help the reader identify the plexus. Layering signal intensities within the thrombosed or slow flowing vessels can be seen on DWI/ADC and T2W images. This feature can help to identify a vein of the periprostatic plexus. A hyperintense rim around the periprostatic venous plexus can be seen on T2W images (especially coronal view) .

	## Thick surgical capsule (transition zone pseudocapsule)
	
	
	
	The transition zone and the peripheral zone both have similar embryological origin. The surgical capsule of the prostate separates the transition zone from the peripheral zone . It is composed of fibromuscular stroma and compressed glandular tissue. This band forms a landmark for surgical enucleation or ablation of transitional zone benign prostate hyperplastic nodules . Poor definition of the surgical capsule on T2-weighted images can sometimes be seen adjacent to transition zone cancers . This band of tissue can also hypertrophy with age and enlargement of the transition zone .

	This band of tissue can also hypertrophy with age and enlargement of the transition zone .
	
	
	
	The surgical capsule is hypointense on T2W with low ADC due to dense compressed fibromuscular tissue and does not demonstrate early focal enhancement (Fig. 4 shows thick pseudocapsule). Its symmetric crescentic band like shape and location should help identify this anatomic landmark.

	that causes protracted bleeding and after biopsy, therefore causing T2 signal intensity decrease. Similar to prostate cancer, hemorrhage is hypointense on T2W and show restricted diffusion (hypointense on ADC) on mpMRI (Fig. 5), and therefore can mimic or obscure focal PCa . However, a matching area of T1 hyperintensity is key to differentiating it from prostate cancer. Hemorrhage can demonstrate focal, diffuse, wedge shaped, or striated high signal on T1W. The intrinsic high T1 of hemorrhage also limits DCE evaluation without subtraction images.

	The presence of the T1 hemorrhage exclusion sign with a corresponding area of low signal intensity on T2-weighted images has been shown be strongly predictive of prostate cancer (95% positive predictive value) . This can be seen in Fig. 5.
	
	## Prostatitis/inflammation
	
	Acute and chronic prostatitis can cause signal changes in the PZ that may be indistinguishable from PCa. Acute bacterial infection is most commonly caused by Escherichia coli and accounts for up to 10% of all prostatitis diagnoses. Acute prostatitis has a bimodal age distribution affecting men aged 20 to 40 years of age and men older than 70 years . Acute prostatitis results in an influx of neutrophils into the prostate.

	Prostatitis can be focal or diffuse involving both the PZ and TZ. On MRI, the affected areas are hypointense on T2W and ADC with mild to moderate diffusion restriction due to the increased inflammatory cellular infiltrate (Fig. 6). The mean ADC of PCa was found to be significantly lower compared with non-cancerous tissue with prostatitis . Similarly, wedge-shaped areas of prostatitis are mildly hypointense on ADC maps . The clinical history of the patient plays a crucial role in distinguishing focal prostatitis from the presence of PCa.

	Granulomatous prostatitis (GP) is an inflammatory condition characterized by the histologic presence of epithelioid granulomas with or without other inflammatory cells and is secondary to prior mycobacterial or fungal infection, prostate biopsy, or systemic granulomatous infection . The diagnosis of GP is on the rise due to increased transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), needle biopsy procedures, and extensive use of intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillation for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) . Clinically, granulomatous prostatitis may present as a focal or diffuse area of induration, often giving a stony hard feel on rectal exam with normal to raised serum PSA levels and/or hematuria.

	It may co-exist with areas of PCa and diagnosis is based on needle biopsy and pathological analysis . Granulomatous inflammation without a causative agent termed non-specific granulomatous prostatitis accounts for 75% of cases. On MRI, focal granulomatous prostatitis has low signal on T2W and low ADC making it difficult to discriminate from PCa with the lesions having lower mean ADC values than higher-grade PCa and are typically assigned higher PI-RADS scores of 4/5 .

	## Focal prostate atrophy
	
	Focal prostate atrophy (FPA) is a common histologic diagnosis found in 73% of biopsy specimens, and occurs most commonly in the PZ. The most common causes of atrophy are inflammation, androgen therapy, and irradiation. The histologic types are proliferative atrophy (PA) and proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) being the most common type [38-40]. The theory of chronic inflammation from PIA leading to accumulated genetic mutations and cellular proliferation causing PCa has not been established. The histologic diagnosis of PIA in negative biopsies correlates with a decreased frequency of detecting PCa in men with persistent suspicion of PCa.

	The histologic diagnosis of PIA in negative biopsies correlates with a decreased frequency of detecting PCa in men with persistent suspicion of PCa.
	
	
	
	There is a positive and significant association between the extent of atrophy and the total or free serum PSA elevation possibly due to damaged epithelial cells in atrophic acini . The imaging features of FPA overlap with PCa on histology and mpMRI .

	On MRIA is seen as a focal area of volume loss usually with wedge-shaped appearance. It is hypointense on T2W, with moderate diffusion restriction and moderate early enhancement on DCE-MR images. Figure 7 shows a focal atrophy that appears as wedge-shaped lesion on T2W. About 26% of peripheral wedge-shaped lesions are associated with non-specific atrophy . However, the diffusion restriction and tissue enhancement is usually less marked than PCa . Asymmetric volume loss due to atrophy can be a way to differentiate focal atrophy from PCa .

	different types of BPH nodules: cystic, stromal, glandular, and mixed . Stromal nodules are hypointense on T2-weighted images due to proliferation of fibromuscular components. They have low ADC signal and demonstrate early enhancement with washout on DCE-MR images mimicking PCa (Fig. 8) . Glandular BPH are not hyperintense on ADC and T2 as previously thought , and have similar appearance on mpMRI as stromal BPH . Cystic BPH are well demarcated and, have higher fluid content due to cystic ectasia and hyperplastic glandular components. They tend to be hyperintense on T2 and ADC images and do not show any early enhancement of DCE-MRI, making it easy to distinguish from PCa.

	About one quarter of all prostate cancers occur in the TZ, making it important to differentiate between benign BPH nodules and TZ cancers . Transition zone cancers are larger, and have higher Gleason grade compared to peripheral zone lesions . Morphology on T2WI can be used to differentiate PCa from BPH nodules. BPH nodules are rounded and better demarcated than PCa. Transition zone PCa have irregular margins, are lenticular shaped, and may show invasion of the AFMS. They have lower ADC values than BPH nodules, although the difference is less profound with the stromal nodules .

	## BPH nodules in the peripheral zone
	
	
	
	Benign prostatic nodules can be found in the peripheral zone (PZ) of the prostate and tend to be glandular in etiology . Histologic tissue analysis suggests some of these nodules originate from the PZ and are not the extension or herniation of TZ nodules . BPH nodules located in the PZ (Fig. 9) are usually well circumscribed, ovoid or round, and do not extend to the capsule . They have low T2 and ADC signal with avid early enhancement and washout very similar to PZ cancers. Their well-defined borders, location (adjacent to TZ), and round shape are the important imaging findings in their differentiation from PZ cancer. In some cases, stromal tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) can appear like nodular region like BPH and extend into the PZ mimicking cancer .

	## Prostatic calcifications
	
	
	
	Prostatic calcifications are relatively common radiologic findings on CT and increases with age over 40 years. They can be associated with disease processes such as BPH, infection, and metabolic abnormalities . Corpora amylacea are presumably precursors to calcified 'stones'. Analysis of the proteins in prostatic corpora amylacea and calculi found that the predominant proteins comprising these concretions are proteins involved in acute inflammation, and in particular proteins contained in neutrophil granules . Prostate calcifications in the prostate are commonly seen at the junction between the transition zone and peripheral zone against the background of BPH.

	tate calcifications in the prostate are commonly seen at the junction between the transition zone and peripheral zone against the background of BPH.
	
	
	
	They are typically hypointense on T2W and ADC, with low signal intensity on DWI at all b values due to the dielectric effect of calcium in the calcification and do not show early enhance on DCE-MRI (Fig. 10). Complete lack of enhancement on MRI is important in their differentiation from PCa. Correlation with CT can be helpful in confirming focal calcification. While corpora amylacea

	Technical challenges can also limit the efficacy of mpMRI. Image distortion, motion artifacts, and endorectal coil placements can affect the PCa diagnosis results using mpMRI.

	Image distortion, motion artifacts, and endorectal coil placements can affect the PCa diagnosis results using mpMRI.
	
	
	
	DWI especially is susceptible to image distortion. DWI uses echo-planar imaging, where gradients are switched to generate diffusion weighting (different b values). This changing magnetic field induces eddy currents, which in turn can create change in the main magnetic field, time-varying gradients, and also degrade the speed and efficiency of gradient switching. Therefore, this leads to a wide range of image artifacts, including shearing, shading, scaling, blurring, and spatial misregistration. High b value DWI is highly susceptible to anatomic distortions and warping, which can lead to obscurity of lesion and false positives. Figure 10 in addition to calcification also shows spatial misregistration between ADC and other mpMRI sequences due to artifacts from DWI echo-planar sequence.

	The presence of stool and rectal gas can produce anatomic distortion/artifacts due to magnetic susceptibility. The use of enema to void the rectum of stool can be effective . The use of left-right phase encoding instead of anterior-posterior can mitigate distortion due to stool and rectal gas. The presence of rectal gas and movement can affect ADC calculations and DCE-MRI images.

	The presence of rectal gas and movement can affect ADC calculations and DCE-MRI images.
	
	
	
	The use of an endorectal coil can induce artifacts. The antenna on the endorectal coil is recommended to be placed at 2 and 10 o'clock position. However, improper coil placement can lead to the artifacts from the antenna which can mimic cancer. Figure 11 shows artifact from an endorectal coil that mimics PCa.
	
	## Conclusion
	
	While mpMRI is a robust application for the diagnosis, staging and targeting of prostate cancer, anatomic, and histologic mimics of prostate cancer exist. Some of these pitfalls can be recognized by evaluating all sequences (summarized in Table 1), while some can only be confirmed with histopathologic evaluation. It is important for the radiologists to recognize these pitfalls while interpreting prostate MRI.
