      "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate has become an essential component in the diagnostic pathway of localized prostate cancer, enabling more precise detection and characterization  of  cancerous  lesions.  Prostate  mpMRI  has  been  shown  to improve clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) diagnosis through targeted biopsies [1,2]. It is also useful for ruling out csPCa, preventing unnecessary biopsies [3]. The quality of the MRI is crucial, given its major  role  in  aiding  cancer  detection  and  guiding  prostate  biopsies. However, the widespread use of mpMRI has also resulted in high variability of scan quality for each sequence across different institutions and countries around the world [4].\n",

      "To improve the image acquisition quality control process, the Prostate  Imaging  Quality  (PI-QUAL)  scoring system from  the  PRECISION study  was  introduced  in  2020  [8]. PI-QUAL  aims  to  assess  prostate mpMRI quality and provide a standardized formal feedback mechanism for scan variability. However, even with a standardized quality scoring system for prostate MRI, there is still no clear consensus on the crucial factors that may impact MRI quality. The quality of mpMRI depends not only on the technical equipment-related factors (magnetic field strength of  MRI,  vendors,  hardware/software)  but  also  on  image  acquisition parameters, and patient-related factors, such as rectal distension, bowel peristalsis, and patient motion (Fig. 1 and Table 1 ).\n",

      "Prostate gland is a walnut sized organ deeply located in the pelvis. Its relatively small size and deep location make it quite challenging to get a high-quality and stable signal for MRI. In order to get a high-quality signal from the prostate, use of a cavitary coil (also known as ERC), was proposed in 1989 by Schnall et al. [11]. This method has been reported to be useful in several studies for detection and staging of prostate cancer [12 -14]. Despite documented benefits of ERC for prostate cancer diagnosis and staging, a variety of drawbacks regarding the use of ERC for MRI of the prostate also  exist,  including  higher  costs,  invasiveness, and patient discomfort, all of which are associated with patient reluctance to undergo prostate MRI.\n",

      "With  increasing  use  of  mpMRI  in  prostate  cancer  diagnosis  and management, excellent quality images with high patient tolerance are needed. PI-RADSv2.1 guidelines acknowledge that the use of ERC enables  a  higher  signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR)  [5].  When  integrated  with external phased-array coil (PAC), ERC increases SNR in the prostate at any magnetic field strength. This  is  particularly  true  for  older  1.5  T scanners; the use of combined ERC-PAC with 1.5 T scanners results in better SNR and therefore a better image quality compared to PAC only images [15,16]. This may be particularly beneficial when high spatial resolution  is  preferred  (i.e.,  cancer  staging).  ERC  usage  can  also  be helpful for intrinsically low-SNR sequences, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)  and  high temporal resolution dynamic  contrastenhanced (DCE) sequences.

      "Regarding the effect of ERC on prostate MRI subjective image quality, prior studies have found mixed results. In most of the studies identified in this narrative review, the image quality rating protocols were similar [17 -23]. Two to six radiologists evaluated image quality and assigned a rating based on a subjective 5-point Likert scale, rating on items such as distinction of zonal anatomy, presence of motion, and artifacts. It  is  important  to  note  that  these  studies  did  not  blind  the readers concerning the coil setup, as ERC arrangements were difficult to conceal  on  scans. Some  studies  showed  no  significant  differences  in perceived image quality on both T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and DWI for 3 T MRI [17 -19], while others reported improved image quality with ERC [20 -22].\n",

Another crucial aspect of quality assessment of MRI is the presence of artifacts, as they can affect visibility and influence image interpretation. The presence of imaging artifacts is often caused by motion or other sources, such as aliasing and susceptibility. Studies have consistently demonstrated  that  ERC  use  was  associated  with  more  artifacts  on prostate MRI [19,21,22] (Fig. 2). One study found that artifact severity score was greater in T2WI acquired with an ERC-PAC compared with just PAC (2. 01 ± 0. 42 vs 1. 39 ± 0. 70, respectively, p = 0. 003). Motion artifact emanating from the interface of the ERC and rectal wall was seen in 17 of 18 T2WI with ERC. However, no significant difference was reported for DWI [19].

These findings may reflect that ERC are more prone to signal inhomogeneity due to the non-uniform reception profile and this effect could be further amplified by poor positioning of the patient and ERC. Susceptibility artifacts could be a result of the direct interface between  soft  tissue  and  air/liquids  in  the  ERC. Moreover,  incorrect positioning and rotation of the ERC may deform or displace the prostate and lead to artifacts [24] (Fig. 3). It may even stimulate bowel peristalsis and thus induce more motion artifacts [18]. Artifacts may be reduced by completely  deflating  the  ERC  to  remove  air  bubbles  and  reflating  it before usage [22].

Apart from the subjective measures, MRI quality can be evaluated objectively, most often with quantifiable parameters such as SNR. SNR is typically  measured  within  regions-of-interest,  drawn  on  the  whole prostate gland including the peripheral zone (PZ) and transitional zone (TZ). It is important to note that measurement of SNR for MRI scans with surface coils or various reconstruction techniques (i. e. , parallel imaging) is  difficult. These  measurements  are  often  estimations  and  may  not reflect  the  true  quantitative  value  [25].

Specifically, number of excitations (SNR is generally proportional to the square root of the number of excitations) was higher for the NERC group, and it may have reduced the advantage of a higher resolution achieved by ERC. In addition, Kim et al.

      "One of the most crucial questions is whether the use of ERC enhances (and ultimately improves) prostate cancer detection on MRI. Indeed, many  studies  have  evaluated  the  diagnostic  performance  of  ERC  vs surface coil in 3 T MRI. Diagnostic performance was most often investigated by parameters such as cancer detection rate, sensitivity, specificity,  and  positive  predictive  value. Most  studies  concluded that the diagnostic performance between ERC and surface coil were comparable [17,20,21,27,28]. However,  in  a  prospective  study  with  49  patients comparing ERC and surface coil, Costa et al. [29] reported 78 % and 43 % sensitivity for overall lesion detection, and 92 % and 47 % sensitivity for index lesion (defined as the lesion with the highest Gleason score or the largest diameter for lesions with the same Gleason score) detection, respectively.\n",

Although these two studies were prospective studies, they were both single institutional studies and were limited by their relatively small  sample  size  and  by  the  fact  that  whole-mount  histopathologic findings were not available for all patients in Costa et al. [29]. Turkbey et al. used 6-channel cardiac coil during NERC MRI scans and 16-channel anterior cardiac coil for ERC scans. Because of this, it may not reflect a true one-to-one comparison of ERC and surface coil groups. Lastly, Mirak et al.

      "In conclusion, the use of ERC provides significant improvement in SNR for both T2WI and DWI, but its effects on subjective image quality and cancer detection in 3 T MRI remains controversial, although most studies suggested ERC does not improve MRI diagnostic performance dramatically. The limited number of studies comparing 1. 5 T MRI with ERC to 3 T MRI with surface coil have demonstrated no significant difference in image quality and cancer detection rates [23]. In addition, one should consider the drawbacks of ERC, such as motion and susceptibility  artifacts,  prostate  distortion,  cost  of  examination,  and, importantly, patient discomfort. It ' s important to note that evaluating the  impact  of  ERC  on  DCE  MRI,  a  component  of  mpMRI,  has  been difficult.\n",

      "that evaluating the  impact  of  ERC  on  DCE  MRI,  a  component  of  mpMRI,  has  been difficult. It  is  impractical  and  unethical  to  administer  intravenous contrast multiple times to each patient on the same day for research purposes. Therefore,  there  is  minimal  data  regarding  this  issue. For patients with hip prothesis, there is also no clear consensus on whether 1. 5 T or 3 T MRI provides better image quality. Lastly, as per PI-RADS v2. 1 guidelines, an ERC should be employed to improve SNR on some older 1. 5 T scanners or in patients with large intra-abdominal fat tissue, where SNR in the gland may be reduced with the use of PAC alone. Nonetheless, all MRI protocols should strive for the best and consistent quality possible with the scanners and tools available. ## 3. Patient preparation-based quality improvement strategies\n",

      "In addition to MRI acquisition methods, several patient-related factors can affect image quality of prostate mpMRI. Some of the common patient-related  factors  are  rectal  air/stool  and  intestinal  peristalsis. These can induce artifacts that interfere with image interpretation and possibly mask cancer suspicious lesions (Fig. 4). There is currently no consensus  about  the  optimal  patient  preparation  prior  to  prostate mpMRI according to PI-RADS v2. 1 recommendations [5]. A variety of approaches have been explored to tackle these issues, such as having patients  emptying  their  bowel  prior  to  MRI  or  using  prone  imaging during MRI.\n",

      "gating the impact of patient preparation methods on prostate MRI quality are summarized in Table 3. Among anti-spasmodic agents, HBB has been the main focus of the majority of the studies on prostate MRI quality. The rationale behind the use of anti-spasmodic agents is to reduce motion-related artifacts that deteriorate image quality. A prior study showed that the benefit of antiperistaltic agents on prostate MRI quality may be limited as the prostate is positioned away from the small bowel [37]. More recent studies on HBB, however, reported that its use is associated with improved subjective reader assessments, especially for T2WI. Most studies identified in this review focused on subjective image quality utilizing a 5-point Likert scale based on reader assessments. In a prospective study of 103 patients, Ullrich et al.

Anti-peristaltic effect from HBB on average lasts around 20 min [40], suggesting that either a second bolus of HBB prior to DCE or a combination of HBB with longer-acting glucagon may be beneficial in the setting of longer imaging protocols. Lastly, it is worth noting that Roethke et al. [41] reported no consequential difference in subjective image  quality  or  artifacts  after  administration  of  HBB. This  may  be partly due to the smaller sample size of 70 patients and moderate interobserver agreement with Cohen ' s  kappa coefficients of 0. 37 -0. 53.

Rectal loading due to excessive air or stool induces DWI distortion and  reduces  image  quality  by  causing  susceptibility  artifacts  [43] (Fig. 5). Susceptibility artifacts tend to occur in areas around the air--tissue interfaces, such as between the rectum and posterior part of the prostate, where most of prostate cancers are found. Removal of rectal air, or the use of prone imaging may overcome susceptibility artifacts. MRI technologists often need to identify these issues, but rescanning is often not possible due to scheduling constraints. Due to these reasons, several techniques to ensure minimal rectal loading before MRI have been  evaluated,  including  enemas,  rectal  catheters,  and  dietary  restrictions (DR).\n",

The current version of PI-QUAL is only the starting point for the evaluation and standardization of prostate mpMRI quality and diagnostic reliability. Future prospective validations and refinements of PI-QUAL are under way. One study has shown that PI-QUAL score is strongly correlated with diagnostic value and artifact severity of mpMRI in patients with hip prosthesis at both 1.5 and 3 T [36]. This suggested that PI-QUAL can be applied to mpMRI in patients with hip prosthesis. Another factor to consider is that the current version of PI-QUAL only applies to mpMRI, therefore a biparametric MRI oriented PI-QUAL system may be needed in the future due to the\n",

      "AI is an emerging technology that is more commonly used in radiology in the recent years. AI can improve the quality of prostate MRI through various approaches, such as image reconstruction and image quality assessment/classification. Although the use of AI is a relatively new topic for prostate MRI quality, there are few studies investigating the roles of AI in prostate MRI quality (Table 5). Image reconstruction is the process of converting raw k-space data acquired by an MR scanner into  a  final  image. Traditional  image  reconstruction  methods  can  be limited by various factors such as loss of SNR and introduction of artifacts [62 -64]. On the other hand, DLR employs convolutional neural networks to learn the mapping from a large dataset of k-space data to the corresponding images.\n",

[72] found DLR with the ERC signal turned off had better subjective overall image quality and less artifacts compared to DLR with the ERC signal turned on and to the conventional reconstruction with ERC.\n",

      "techniques have the potential to reduce scan time and provide more comfortable experience for the patients. mpMRI typically has a long examination time of &gt; 30 min; this can be especially difficult for patients who are elderly or claustrophobic. The duration of the MRI examination greatly influences its cost and accessibility. As the scan time increases, the images become more vulnerable to motion artifacts as well. Past studies have consistently shown that implementation of DLR can reduce MRI acquisition time (up to 76 % reduction) while attaining similar or better image quality [66,67,69 -71,73 -75]. This is achieved by reducing the  number  of  excitations  to  accelerate  acquisition  time  and  subsequently improve SNR and CNR via DLR.\n",

The per-slice classification accuracy was 90.0 % for T2WI, 80.0 % for DWI, 76.6 % for ADC, and 96.6 % for DCE. The per-sequence accuracy was 100 % for T2WI, DWI, and DCE, and 92.3 % for ADC. While the results were promising, its impact on diagnostic performance was not evaluated. In addition, generalizability may be restricted  as  only  a  limited  number  of  sequences  (n = 869) generated from one MR scanner were used for training. The algorithm also employed a binary classification to assess image quality, a semiquantitative  scale  with  multiple  scores  may  be  more  applicable  to address the complexity of MRI scans.\n",

      "In  conclusion,  assurance  of  high-quality  MRIs  is  of  paramount importance for prostate mpMRI to contribute to clinical management of localized  prostate  cancer. Several  strategies  have  been  tried  and  reported to improve prostate MRI quality. Use of endorectal coil at 3 T magnets has been documented to improve objective image quality by providing an increase in SNR. However, its effects on subjective overall image quality and cancer detection still remains controversial. Patient preparation-based  strategies  have  been  more  studied  in  the  last  half decade. Among them, the use of anti-spasmodics such as HBB can reduce rectal motion and improve image quality, particularly for T2WI.\n",

      "i-spasmodics such as HBB can reduce rectal motion and improve image quality, particularly for T2WI. On the other hand, studies on the use of enema before MRI exams have conflicting results but the current literature suggests that the use of a preparatory rectal enema in conjunction to DR is superior to HBB in terms of improving DWI image quality with minimal side effects and costs. There is compelling evidence to support the standardization of prostate MRI quality using objective and pre-defined criteria, and the PI-QUAL score is the first attempt to bridge this gap. With the limited number of studies to date, the reproducibility of the PI-QUAL has been shown to be moderate and higher PI-QUAL scores may improve efficiency of diagnostic pathway  of  prostate  cancer  by  reducing  false-positive  MRI  calls  and unnecessary biopsies.\n",
