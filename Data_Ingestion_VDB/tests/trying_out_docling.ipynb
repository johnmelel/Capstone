      "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate has become an essential component in the diagnostic pathway of localized prostate cancer, enabling more precise detection and characterization  of  cancerous  lesions.  Prostate  mpMRI  has  been  shown  to improve clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) diagnosis through targeted biopsies [1,2]. It is also useful for ruling out csPCa, preventing unnecessary biopsies [3]. The quality of the MRI is crucial, given its major  role  in  aiding  cancer  detection  and  guiding  prostate  biopsies. However, the widespread use of mpMRI has also resulted in high variability of scan quality for each sequence across different institutions and countries around the world [4].\n",
      "\n",
      "As a response to the growth in the use of mpMRI, the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) guidelines, the most recent iteration being the PI-RADSv2.1, were introduced to standardize prostate mpMRI acquisition, interpretation, and reporting [5]. Importantly, PI-RADSv2  established  the  minimum  technical  requirements  for  the acquisition of the individual MRI sequences with the goal of standardizing imaging protocols and reducing variability in image quality [6]. Nevertheless, adherence to these requirements is variable across both academic  and  non-academic  institutions  and  does  not  necessarily\n",

      "Multiparametric  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (mpMRI)  plays  a  vital  role  in  prostate  cancer  diagnosis  and management. With the increase in use of mpMRI, obtaining the best possible  quality images  has  become a priority. The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) was introduced to standardize and optimize patient preparation, scanning techniques, and interpretation. However, the quality of the MRI sequences depends not  only  on  the  hardware/software  and  scanning  parameters,  but  also  on  patient-related  factors.  Common patient-related  factors  include  bowel  peristalsis,  rectal  distension,  and  patient  motion.  There  is  currently  no consensus regarding the best approaches to address these issues and improve the quality of mpMRI. New evidence has been accrued since the release of PI-RADS, and this review aims to explore the key strategies which aim to improve prostate MRI quality, such as imaging techniques, patient preparation methods, the new Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL) criteria, and artificial intelligence on prostate MRI quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "translate into acquiring high-quality scans [7]. These issues are often unrecognized, and the diagnostic performance of mpMRI of the prostate, especially in non-academic centers, is assumed to be similar to published data when in practice this is most likely not the case as low quality images end up being excluded from the studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the image acquisition quality control process, the Prostate  Imaging  Quality  (PI-QUAL)  scoring system from  the  PRECISION study  was  introduced  in  2020  [8].  PI-QUAL  aims  to  assess  prostate mpMRI quality and provide a standardized formal feedback mechanism for scan variability. However, even with a standardized quality scoring system for prostate MRI, there is still no clear consensus on the crucial factors that may impact MRI quality. The quality of mpMRI depends not only on the technical equipment-related factors (magnetic field strength of  MRI,  vendors,  hardware/software)  but  also  on  image  acquisition parameters, and patient-related factors, such as rectal distension, bowel peristalsis, and patient motion (Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). The research initiatives undertaken to improve image quality in prostate MRI have been centered around optimizing image acquisition (e.g., use of endorectal coil [ERC]), employment of various patient preparation methods, and quality control methods (e.g., PI-QUAL). These issues were particularly amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many centers across the world were forced to change their MRI protocols, such as discontinuing\n",

      "Prostate gland is a walnut sized organ deeply located in the pelvis. Its relatively small size and deep location make it quite challenging to get a high-quality and stable signal for MRI. In order to get a high-quality signal from the prostate, use of a cavitary coil (also known as ERC), was proposed in 1989 by Schnall et al. [11]. This method has been reported to be useful in several studies for detection and staging of prostate cancer [12 -14]. Despite documented benefits of ERC for prostate cancer diagnosis and staging, a variety of drawbacks regarding the use of ERC for MRI of the prostate also  exist,  including  higher  costs,  invasiveness, and patient discomfort, all of which are associated with patient reluctance to undergo prostate MRI.\n",
      "\n",
      "With  increasing  use  of  mpMRI  in  prostate  cancer  diagnosis  and management, excellent quality images with high patient tolerance are needed. PI-RADSv2.1 guidelines acknowledge that the use of ERC enables  a  higher  signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR)  [5].  When  integrated  with external phased-array coil (PAC), ERC increases SNR in the prostate at any magnetic field strength. This  is  particularly  true  for  older  1.5  T scanners; the use of combined ERC-PAC with 1.5 T scanners results in better SNR and therefore a better image quality compared to PAC only images [15,16]. This may be particularly beneficial when high spatial resolution  is  preferred  (i.e.,  cancer  staging).  ERC  usage  can  also  be helpful for intrinsically low-SNR sequences, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)  and  high temporal resolution dynamic  contrastenhanced (DCE) sequences. However, a higher magnetic field strength\n",

Two to six radiologists evaluated image quality and assigned a rating based on a subjective 5-point Likert scale, rating on items such as distinction of zonal anatomy, presence of motion, and artifacts.  It  is  important  to  note  that  these  studies  did  not  blind  the readers concerning the coil setup, as ERC arrangements were difficult to conceal  on  scans.  Some  studies  showed  no  significant  differences  in perceived image quality on both T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and DWI for 3 T MRI [17 -19], while others reported improved image quality with ERC [20 -22]. Specifically, in a prospective single institution study with 45 patients, Baur et al. [21] described better overall T2WI quality ratings with ERC-PAC compared to PAC only (p = 0.004).

This study  only  included  patients  without  prostate  cancer  which  were confirmed with at least one transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided systematic biopsy of the prostate. As a result, there could be a selection bias towards patients with prostate cancer in uncommon locations or benign conditions associated with persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen. In contrast, in a prospective two institutional study with 98 patients,  Barth  et  al.  [22]  found  no  significant  difference  in  overall image quality scores for T2WI between PAC-only and ERC-PAC groups (p = 0.56). For DWI quality, one reader reported similar assessment scores (3.03 ± 1.10 and 3.08 ± 0.80, respectively, p = 0.67), whereas another reader rated ERC setup higher (3.27 ± 0.81 and 3.66 ± 0.85, respectively,  p &lt; 0.05).  In  this  study,  however,  not  all  scanning  parameters were kept constant between ERC and non-ERC (NERC) MRIs. In summary, past studies provided variable results in subjective image quality comparisons between ERC and NERC. This variation likely arises from the limitations in blinding ERC cases within reader studies and variable center-specific adherence to image acquisition guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another crucial aspect of quality assessment of MRI is the presence of artifacts, as they can affect visibility and influence image interpretation. The presence of imaging artifacts is often caused by motion or other sources, such as aliasing and susceptibility. Studies have consistently demonstrated  that  ERC  use  was  associated  with  more  artifacts  on prostate MRI [19,21,22] (Fig. 2). One study found that artifact severity score was greater in T2WI acquired with an ERC-PAC compared with just PAC (2.01 ± 0.42 vs 1.39 ± 0.70, respectively, p = 0.003). Motion artifact emanating from the interface of the ERC and rectal wall was seen in 17 of 18 T2WI with ERC. However, no significant difference was reported for DWI [19]. Baur et al. demonstrated similar findings with more artifacts  being  noted in  ERC  group for  T2WI [21]. In another study, Barth  et  al.  [22]  reported  that  susceptibility  artifacts  were  more commonly observed in DWI while Ullrich et al. [18] reported ERC group had more motion artifacts in T2WI but less motion artifacts in DWI. One study reported no significant difference in artifacts for both ERC-PAC and PAC setup [20]. In the study, an anti-peristaltic agent (i.e., 1 mg of glucagon) was intravenously administrated twice during the examination.  The  use  of  anti-peristaltic  agents  could  have  reduced  motion artifacts.  Overall,  studies  suggested  that  ERC  was  associated  with increased artifacts, particularly motion and susceptibility artifacts, for both T2WI and DWI. These findings may reflect that ERC are more prone to signal inhomogeneity due to the non-uniform reception profile and this effect could be further amplified by poor positioning of the patient and ERC. Susceptibility artifacts could be a result of the direct interface between  soft  tissue  and  air/liquids  in  the  ERC.  Moreover,  incorrect positioning and rotation of the ERC may deform or displace the prostate and lead to artifacts [24] (Fig. 3). It may even stimulate bowel peristalsis and thus induce more motion artifacts [18]. Artifacts may be reduced by completely  deflating  the  ERC  to  remove  air  bubbles  and  reflating  it before usage [22]. It must be also noted that if present, rectal air may mimic susceptibility artifacts seen with ERC usage.\n",

      "Apart from the subjective measures, MRI quality can be evaluated objectively, most often with quantifiable parameters such as SNR. SNR is typically  measured  within  regions-of-interest,  drawn  on  the  whole prostate gland including the peripheral zone (PZ) and transitional zone (TZ). It is important to note that measurement of SNR for MRI scans with surface coils or various reconstruction techniques (i.e., parallel imaging) is  difficult.  These  measurements  are  often  estimations  and  may  not reflect  the  true  quantitative  value  [25].  Numerous  studies  have confirmed the use of ERC improves SNR for 3 T MRI on both T2WI and DWI [18,19,26]. One study measured a higher SNR for DWI with NERC group compared to ERC group [22]. However, there was no significant difference in SNR for T2WI acquired with NERC and ERC in the whole gland (22.7 ± 5.0 and 21.3 ± 6.6; p = 0.08). It is worth noting that not all parameters were kept constant between the sequences acquired with the ERC and NERC groups in this study. Specifically, number of excitations (SNR is generally proportional to the square root of the number of excitations) was higher for the NERC group, and it may have reduced the advantage of a higher resolution achieved by ERC. In addition, Kim et al. [27] reported no significant difference in T2WI SNR between the ERC and NERC groups, though the authors did note that SNR in the ERC group was higher without statistical significance (14.75 vs 11.53, p = 0.08). Mazaheri et al. [26] found mean DWI SNR with ERC for PZ was 66.33 ± 27.07 and TZ was 32.69 ± 12.52 while mean SNR with NERC was 7.32 ± 2.30 and 6.13 ± 1.56, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001 for both). Ullrich et al. [18] found T2WI SNRs with ERC for PZ was 76.74 and TZ was 52.49, while SNRs with NERC for PZ and TZ were 33.99 and 34.94,\n",

      "One of the most crucial questions is whether the use of ERC enhances (and ultimately improves) prostate cancer detection on MRI. Indeed, many  studies  have  evaluated  the  diagnostic  performance  of  ERC  vs surface coil in 3 T MRI. Diagnostic performance was most often investigated by parameters such as cancer detection rate, sensitivity, specificity,  and  positive  predictive  value.  Most  studies  concluded that the diagnostic performance between ERC and surface coil were comparable [17,20,21,27,28].  However,  in  a  prospective  study  with  49  patients comparing ERC and surface coil, Costa et al. [29] reported 78 % and 43 % sensitivity for overall lesion detection, and 92 % and 47 % sensitivity for index lesion (defined as the lesion with the highest Gleason score or the largest diameter for lesions with the same Gleason score) detection, respectively.  In  another  prospective  study  with  20  patients,  Turkbey et al. [30] reported 76 % and 45 % sensitivity for ERC and surface coil, respectively. Although these two studies were prospective studies, they were both single institutional studies and were limited by their relatively small  sample  size  and  by  the  fact  that  whole-mount  histopathologic findings were not available for all patients in Costa et al. [29]. Turkbey et al. used 6-channel cardiac coil during NERC MRI scans and 16-channel anterior cardiac coil for ERC scans. Because of this, it may not reflect a true one-to-one comparison of ERC and surface coil groups. Lastly, Mirak et al. [28] conducted a retrospective case-control study including 429 patients who underwent 3 T MRI with and without an ERC prior to prostatectomy. The study found ERC vs surface coil had similar detection of overall and index prostate cancer. However, the ERC cohort had significantly higher detection of cancers located posteriorly and in the PZ, but had lower detection rates of cancers located anteriorly and in the TZ. In the ERC and surface coil cohorts, 35.9 % (66 of 184) and 48.4 % (76 of 157) of anterior cancers (p = 0.02), 58 % (200 of 345) and 48.1 % (89 of 185) of posterior cancers (p = 0.03), 37.3 % (41 of 110) and 54.4 % (62 of 114) of TZ cancers (p = 0.01), and 53.7 % (225 of 419) and 45.2 % (103 of 228) of PZ cancers (p = 0.03) were detected, respectively. Restricting the study sample to surgery patients may result in selection bias, and findings may not be generalizable to overall population. Surgery patients will likely have more obvious and larger lesions on MRI, and ERC usage may not impact the diagnostic rates. However, without having a gold standard ground truth like whole-mount histopathology, it is difficult to evaluate the whole gland for cancer presence. Nevertheless, radiologists need to be aware of this mismatch between ERC  and  anterior/transition  zone  lesions  especially  as  anterior  and transition zones are often under-sampled on routine TRUS-guided biopsy [31].\n",

      "Another critical discussion on the use of hardware for prostate MRI scans is 1.5 T vs 3 T magnets. Obviously 3 T magnets brings an advantage for the desired SNR, however there may be a few drawbacks. For patients with some models of medical instruments, such as aneurysm clips,  vena  cava  filters,  3  T  MRI  may  not  be  safe.  Additionally,  hip prosthesis can cause susceptibility artifacts and impact diagnostic performance  of  prostate  MRIs.  Metalwork  can  lead  to  signal  drop  out, making  it  difficult  to  distinguish  between  normal  tissue  and  cancer suspicious  lesions.  The  severity  of  the  artifacts  depends  on  the  size, location, and composition of the prosthesis. Another challenge is the increased motion artifacts caused by the hip prosthesis. Patients with hip prostheses  often  have  limited  mobility  and  may  experience  pain  or discomfort during the exam, which can lead to increased voluntary/ involuntary  motions.  To  overcome  these  issues,  some  proposed  the utilization of 1.5 T MR scanners over 3 T for patients with hip prosthesis [32].  The  rationale  is  that  although  3  T  MRI  generates  higher  SNR compared to 1.5 T, it often suffers more from susceptibility and ghosting artifacts due to geometric distortion [33 -35]. However, there is only one study so far that directly compares the image quality of 1.5 T and 3 T MRI for patients with hip prosthesis [36]. In a retrospective multicenter study with 140 patients with uni- or bilateral total hip replacement, Boschheidgen et al. [36] found no significant difference between subjective artifact severity in prostate mpMRI of patients with hip prosthesis between 1.5 T and 3 T MRI. This study is only a starting point and additional research is needed to establish a standardized imaging protocol  for  patients  with  hip  prosthesis.  Furthermore,  deep  learning reconstruction (DLR) may play an important role in 1.5 T MRI in the\n",

      "In conclusion, the use of ERC provides significant improvement in SNR for both T2WI and DWI, but its effects on subjective image quality and cancer detection in 3 T MRI remains controversial, although most studies suggested ERC does not improve MRI diagnostic performance dramatically. The limited number of studies comparing 1.5 T MRI with ERC to 3 T MRI with surface coil have demonstrated no significant difference in image quality and cancer detection rates [23]. In addition, one should consider the drawbacks of ERC, such as motion and susceptibility  artifacts,  prostate  distortion,  cost  of  examination,  and, importantly, patient discomfort. It ' s important to note that evaluating the  impact  of  ERC  on  DCE  MRI,  a  component  of  mpMRI,  has  been difficult.  It  is  impractical  and  unethical  to  administer  intravenous contrast multiple times to each patient on the same day for research purposes.  Therefore,  there  is  minimal  data  regarding  this  issue.  For patients with hip prothesis, there is also no clear consensus on whether 1.5 T or 3 T MRI provides better image quality. Lastly, as per PI-RADS v2.1 guidelines, an ERC should be employed to improve SNR on some older 1.5 T scanners or in patients with large intra-abdominal fat tissue, where SNR in the gland may be reduced with the use of PAC alone. Nonetheless, all MRI protocols should strive for the best and consistent quality possible with the scanners and tools available.\n",

      "In addition to MRI acquisition methods, several patient-related factors can affect image quality of prostate mpMRI. Some of the common patient-related  factors  are  rectal  air/stool  and  intestinal  peristalsis. These can induce artifacts that interfere with image interpretation and possibly mask cancer suspicious lesions (Fig. 4). There is currently no consensus  about  the  optimal  patient  preparation  prior  to  prostate mpMRI according to PI-RADS v2.1 recommendations [5]. A variety of approaches have been explored to tackle these issues, such as having patients  emptying  their  bowel  prior  to  MRI  or  using  prone  imaging during MRI. More complex methods have also been employed, including the use of anti-spasmodic/anti-peristaltic agents hyoscine butylbromide (HBB), also known as scopolamine butylbromide, or glucagon to reduce rectal motion, or micro-enema to decrease rectal air and stool. Studies investigating the impact of patient preparation methods on prostate MRI quality are summarized in Table 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among anti-spasmodic agents, HBB has been the main focus of the majority of the studies on prostate MRI quality. The rationale behind the use of anti-spasmodic agents is to reduce motion-related artifacts that deteriorate image quality. A prior study showed that the benefit of antiperistaltic agents on prostate MRI quality may be limited as the prostate is positioned away from the small bowel [37]. More recent studies on HBB, however, reported that its use is associated with improved subjective reader assessments, especially for T2WI. Most studies identified in this review focused on subjective image quality utilizing a 5-point Likert scale based on reader assessments. In a prospective study of 103 patients, Ullrich et al. [38] reported improvement in both visualization of  anatomic  structures  (mean  score  3.4  before  administration  vs  4.4 after, p &lt; 0.001) and motion-related artifacts (mean score 3.2 before vs 4.2 after, p &lt; 0.001) on T2WIs for about 68 % of the patients. In addition,  Slough  et  al.  [39]  showed  better  subjective  T2WI  quality  after administration of HBB in 173 patients in a retrospective study (HBB score 3.63 vs non-HBB 2.84, p &lt; 0.001). The HBB group also had less blurring and motion artifacts compared to non-HBB group. No significant difference on DWI or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) image quality were reported in the aforementioned study. Although the results showed a trend towards improved quality of DCE, it did not reach statistical significance (HBB corrupt data points 2.47 vs non-HBB 3.68, p =\n",

Anti-peristaltic effect from HBB on average lasts around 20 min [40], suggesting that either a second bolus of HBB prior to DCE or a combination of HBB with longer-acting glucagon may be beneficial in the setting of longer imaging protocols. Lastly, it is worth noting that Roethke et al. [41] reported no consequential difference in subjective image  quality  or  artifacts  after  administration  of  HBB.  This  may  be partly due to the smaller sample size of 70 patients and moderate interobserver agreement with Cohen ' s  kappa coefficients of 0.37 -0.53. In summary, studies have demonstrated an improvement in image quality of  T2WI  after  intravenous  administration  of  HBB.  Nonetheless,  HBB administration  increases  MRI  preparation  time  and  cost.  It  is  often associated  with  unwanted  side  effects,  mostly  related  to  its  anticholinergic activity, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and dizziness [42]. Therefore, the added costs (i.e., costs associated with administration of the medicine) and potential for adverse reactions should be taken into consideration when deciding on whether to use HBB for prostate MRI.\n",

      "Rectal loading due to excessive air or stool induces DWI distortion and  reduces  image  quality  by  causing  susceptibility  artifacts  [43] (Fig. 5). Susceptibility artifacts tend to occur in areas around the air--tissue interfaces, such as between the rectum and posterior part of the prostate, where most of prostate cancers are found. Removal of rectal air, or the use of prone imaging may overcome susceptibility artifacts. MRI technologists often need to identify these issues, but rescanning is often not possible due to scheduling constraints. Due to these reasons, several techniques to ensure minimal rectal loading before MRI have been  evaluated,  including  enemas,  rectal  catheters,  and  dietary  restrictions (DR). Self-administration of enema in a hospital setting before MRI may be stressful for many patients, leading to higher risk of unsuccessful bowel preparation. Administrating at home the day of the exam can be a suitable alternative to increase the success of the application and ensure enema can take effect before the study.\n",

However,  this  study  included  a  relatively  small  cohort  of  60  patients,  in which no patients had significant amount of rectal gas. Moreover, interreader  agreement  was  not  assessed.  Coskun  et  al.  [44]  showed  that enema may diminish rectal air but with minor effects on DWI distortion and overall image quality. In this study, there was a notable inter-reader variability regarding the assessment of image quality and artifacts, with Cohen ' s kappa coefficients ranging from 0.08 to 0.53. Plodeck et al. [45] reported that application of enema significantly reduces both the incidence and severity of artifacts on DWI in a retrospective study of 114 patients. However, they did not directly analyze the effect of enema on overall image quality. In another study, Reischauer et al. [47] compared the use of enema to catheter preparation. The authors demonstrated that enema preparation was superior to catheter preparation regarding the image quality of DWI and reduced the occurrence of susceptibility artifacts.  Direct  comparison  to  non-enema  group  was  not  performed, therefore, no firm conclusion could be reached regarding enema vs nonenema groups. Arnoldner et al. [48] incorporated endorectal gel-filling in addition to the conventional enema to create a novel rectal preparation protocol. In their prospective study, the authors concluded enema plus endorectal gel-filling improved overall image quality on DWI and lesion visibility on T2WI. They have also reported improved PI-QUAL scores  with  their  bowel  preparation  technique.  This  study  did  not include an enema-only cohort either. Overall, studies have shown conflicting results on whether the use of enema improves image quality and reduces  artifacts  on  prostate  mpMRI.  Further  research  is  needed  to validate the reports of these studies.\n",

      "More  recent  studies  have  investigated  enema  administration  in combination with other patient preparation methods, such as HBB and DR [49 -51]. In a retrospective study of 180 patients, Schmidt et al. [49] concluded that enema improved image quality while HBB and DR did not have any significant effects. Purysko et al. [50] found that enema and/or  DE  improved  the  overall  image  quality  of  prostate  MRI  by decreasing rectal distension and distortion of DWI. Similarly, in a study consist of 280 patients, Sathiadoss et al. [51] compared five different preparation  strategies  for  prostate  MRI:  no  preparation,  DR,  enema, enema plus DR, enema plus DR and HBB. The study reported enema plus DR before prostate MRI yielded the highest T2WI and DWI quality with the least artifacts on DWI. Rectal distension was reduced significantly with the administration of enema. Unlike enema and DR, HBB did not result in an improvement in image quality on T2WI or DWI or lessen DWI artifacts despite diminishing the motion artifacts on T2WI.\n",

      "In brief, there was an existing heterogeneity in patient cohorts and methodologies in the aforementioned studies. Variation in dietary habits due to difference in locations and cultures can influence rectal distension and therefore affect image quality. In addition, inconsistency in study protocols, such as variability in timing of enema administration and dose/type  of  anti-peristaltic  agents  can  impact  image  quality  as well.

More  studies  are  needed  to  further  investigate  whether  different administration  routes  of  HBB  impact  prostate  MRI  quality.  Overall, studies have shown that the use of anti-spasmodic agents such as HBB can reduce rectal motion, improve image quality, particularly T2WI. HBB should be given as late as possible to ensure that MRI takes place during  the  biological  activity  window  of  the  anti-spasmolytics.  Antispasmodic agents may be beneficial in some patients with hyper-motile intestine or flatulence. However, in many others it may not be necessary, and the additional cost and potential for adverse drug reactions should always be taken into consideration. On the other hand, past studies on the use of enema before MRI exams have contradicting results. Recent studies with larger patient cohorts seem to suggest that the use of a preparatory rectal enema alone or in conjunction with DR is superior to HBB in terms of improving mpMRI image quality with minimal side effects and additional cost.\n",

      "PI-RADS  aims  to  standardize  and  improve  the  performance  and interpretation of prostate mpMRI by setting minimum technical standards  and  providing  suggestions  to  improve  image  quality.  In  real clinical  practice,  adherence  to  these  minimum  technical  standards  is highly variable, especially in non-academic institutions [53]. It must be noted that adherence to the PI-RADS technical recommendations does not necessarily translate into good-quality prostate mpMRIs [7]. With some MRIs, better results may be obtained with technical parameters outside the recommendations. While technical parameters are critical, several other factors such as patient motion, rectal air-related artifacts, and coil utilization can impact MRI quality. The available data published over the last decade are conflicting and draw mixed conclusions in terms of patient preparation and image acquisition. This is corroborated by the fact that studies often included a different subjective scoring system, mostly based on a 1 -5 Likert scale. Even with the recently updated PIRADS v2.1 recommendations, there is still vast inconsistency on how to  produce  images  of  the  best  quality.  Furthermore,  there  is  no consensus  on  what  constitutes  a  good  quality  prostate  MRI  and  no standardized criteria to assess image quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these problems and provide a more standardized assessment, Giganti et al. [8] introduced a novel scoring system, PI-QUAL, that evaluate each sequence against the PI-RADS standards and assigns a score to prostate MRI quality. The PI-QUAL score ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates that none of the three MRI sequences (T2WI, DWI and DCE) are of diagnostic quality, 3 indicates that at least two MRI sequences  taken  together  are  of  acceptable  diagnostic  quality,  and  5 means that each sequence is independently of optimal diagnostic quality\n",

      "As PI-QUAL was introduced only in 2020, a limited number of studies on PI-QUAL and its impact on improving prostate MRI quality have been published [36,48,54 -58]. The full details are shown in Table 4 . Studies have  focused  on  evaluating  the  inter-reader  agreement  of  PI-QUAL scores  between  two  readers.  Most  found  the  reproducibility  of  PIQUAL  was  moderate  with  Cohen ' s  kappa  coefficients  between  0.42 and 0.55 [48,54 -56]. Giganti et al. [58] reported substantial agreement between  two  experienced  radiologists  in  the  assessment  of  PI-QUAL (weighted  kappa = 0.82,  with  84  %  agreement),  but  it  should  be pointed out that the two readers were involved in the development of the PI-QUAL score [8], and presumably were more familiar with the scoring system than the readers from the other studies. They also had significantly more prostate MRI reading experience (both read &gt; 1,800 prostate MRI scans per year, one with 7 years of experience and the other with 20 years of experience) compared to average readers. Therefore, the true inter-reader agreement for PI-QUAL in clinical practice requires further validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The standardized evaluation and reporting of image quality via PIQUAL truly fulfills its purpose only if PI-QUAL scores have an objective impact on csPCa (defined as Gleason Grade Group ≥ 2) detection. The limited number of studies so far suggested that higher PI-QUAL score  may  improve  the  efficiency  of  diagnostic  pathway  of  prostate cancer by reducing false-positive MRI calls and unnecessary biopsies. In a  retrospective  study  with  50  patients  undergoing  MRI-TRUS  fusion biopsy, Potsch et al. [54] reported that overall diagnostic performance did not differ between studies with optimal diagnostic quality compared to lower diagnostic quality (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC] for PI-QUAL &gt; 3: 0.805 vs for PI-QUAL ≤ 3: 0.839, p = 0.55). However, the prevalence of csPCa was lower when the PIQUAL score was ≤ 3 compared to &gt; 3 (16.7 % vs 30.2 %, p = 0.008). Scans with PI-QUAL &gt; 3 also had higher positive predictive value (PIQUAL &gt; 3: 56 % vs PI-QUAL ≤ 3: 36 %, p = 0.001). This suggested csPCa may be more apparent with higher quality scans, and the low-quality images may lead to false-positive calls and subsequent unnecessary biopsies, lowering the biopsy yield of high PI-RADS scores. However, it is worth  mentioning  that  this  study  used  a  modified  PI-RADS  scoring scheme where the prostate was divided into six regions and each region was assigned a PI-RADS score. In another retrospective study of 247 patients, Karanasios et al. [55] reported that when comparing PI-QUAL 5 to PI-QUAL 3 studies, the PI-RADS 1 -2 calls increased from 50 to 87 % and PI-RADS 3 calls decreased from 31.8 to 10.4 %. More patients with PI-QUAL 1 -3 underwent biopsy for PI-RADS 1 -2 (47 %) and 3 (100 %) MRIs  compared  to  patients  with  PI-QUAL  score  4 -5  (30  and  75  %, respectively). Dinneen et al. [57] specifically investigated the impact of PI-QUAL score on diagnostic accuracy of extra-prostatic extension on mpMRI. The authors reported the extra-prostatic extension prediction was more reliable with higher PI-QUAL scores with an AUC of 0.92 (95 % CI: 0.88-0.96) for PI-QUAL 4 -5 scans and AUC of 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.72 -0.84)  for  PI-QUAL  1 -3  scans.  In  summary,  studies  suggest  that better quality scans with higher PI-QUAL scores have limited effect on overall diagnostic performance of MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy, but they are associated with improved rates of extra-prostatic extension prediction and increased efficiency of prostate cancer diagnosis by reducing unnecessary biopsies.\n",

      "Quality  evaluation  of  MRI  sequences  is  one  of  the  key  steps  for successful prostate cancer diagnosis using MRI. The current version of PI-QUAL is only the starting point for the evaluation and standardization of prostate mpMRI quality and diagnostic reliability. Future prospective validations and refinements of PI-QUAL are under way. One study has shown that PI-QUAL score is strongly correlated with diagnostic value and artifact severity of mpMRI in patients with hip prosthesis at both 1.5 and 3 T [36]. This suggested that PI-QUAL can be applied to mpMRI in patients with hip prosthesis. Another factor to consider is that the current version of PI-QUAL only applies to mpMRI, therefore a biparametric MRI oriented PI-QUAL system may be needed in the future due to the\n",

Defining scan quality is highly subjective and experience dependent, and readers are likely to disagree on what constitutes optimal quality.

Automated  tools,  including  AI based on deep learning, may provide a more objective and consistent assessment  of  image  quality  and  initial  attempts  to  create  semiautomated software have been made [60]. However, such algorithms are under development and not yet widely used in clinical practice. Until then, attempts on standardizing quality assessment with initiatives such as  PI-QUAL  holds  a  great  value  and  initial  results  from  dedicated teaching courses on image quality have been shown to be successful [61].

      "AI is an emerging technology that is more commonly used in radiology in the recent years. AI can improve the quality of prostate MRI through various approaches, such as image reconstruction and image quality assessment/classification. Although the use of AI is a relatively new topic for prostate MRI quality, there are few studies investigating the roles of AI in prostate MRI quality (Table 5). Image reconstruction is the process of converting raw k-space data acquired by an MR scanner into  a  final  image.  Traditional  image  reconstruction  methods  can  be limited by various factors such as loss of SNR and introduction of artifacts [62 -64]. On the other hand, DLR employs convolutional neural networks to learn the mapping from a large dataset of k-space data to the corresponding images. It can reduce noise and artifacts, therefore results in more accurate and detailed final images [65]. This approach has been shown to  provide  higher  subjective  overall  image  quality,  SNR,  and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for both T2WI and DWI than images taken with  the  same  parameters  and  processed  using  other  approaches [66 -73]. When correlated to pathology, one study showed diagnostic performance for the evaluation of extra-prostatic extension were similar between DLR and conventional protocol [69]. Furthermore, Wang et al. [72] found DLR with the ERC signal turned off had better subjective overall image quality and less artifacts compared to DLR with the ERC signal turned on and to the conventional reconstruction with ERC. This study  suggested  that  scans  acquired  without  ERC  could  potentially benefit  from  DLR  to  enhance  image  quality.  Important  to  note,  the groups with the ERC signal turned off still had the ERC in place. This removed confounding factors such as ERC positional differences and technical parameter variations, but it does not allow the direct assessment of the effect of removing the ERC on overall image quality.

The duration of the MRI examination greatly influences its cost and accessibility. As the scan time increases, the images become more vulnerable to motion artifacts as well. Past studies have consistently shown that implementation of DLR can reduce MRI acquisition time (up to 76 % reduction) while attaining similar or better image quality [66,67,69 -71,73 -75]. This is achieved by reducing the  number  of  excitations  to  accelerate  acquisition  time  and  subsequently improve SNR and CNR via DLR.\n",

      "\n",
      "In  conclusion,  assurance  of  high-quality  MRIs  is  of  paramount importance for prostate mpMRI to contribute to clinical management of localized  prostate  cancer.  Several  strategies  have  been  tried  and  reported to improve prostate MRI quality. Use of endorectal coil at 3 T magnets has been documented to improve objective image quality by providing an increase in SNR. However, its effects on subjective overall image quality and cancer detection still remains controversial. Patient preparation-based  strategies  have  been  more  studied  in  the  last  half decade. Among them, the use of anti-spasmodics such as HBB can reduce rectal motion and improve image quality, particularly for T2WI. On the other hand, studies on the use of enema before MRI exams have conflicting results but the current literature suggests that the use of a preparatory rectal enema in conjunction to DR is superior to HBB in terms of improving DWI image quality with minimal side effects and costs. There is compelling evidence to support the standardization of prostate MRI quality using objective and pre-defined criteria, and the PI-QUAL score is the first attempt to bridge this gap. With the limited number of studies to date, the reproducibility of the PI-QUAL has been shown to be moderate and higher PI-QUAL scores may improve efficiency of diagnostic pathway  of  prostate  cancer  by  reducing  false-positive  MRI  calls  and unnecessary biopsies. Lastly, AI-based image reconstruction, which is a very new field, can significantly improve both objective and subjective image  quality  while  reducing  MRI  acquisition  time.  For  all  of  these quality improvement strategies, further prospective studies are needed to document their clinical impact and value.\n",
